# Prioqueue

Prioqueue contains well-structured priority queues for Elixir:

- A single, public interface.
- Multiple implementations with difference performance properties. Decide the best one later on in your configuration settings, after building your application!

by adding `prioqueue` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:
